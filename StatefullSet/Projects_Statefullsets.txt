✅ 1. Health Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
Why:
You want to monitor your MySQL cluster’s health, replication lag, query rate, errors, etc., visually in real time.

How:

Install Prometheus and Grafana in your cluster.

Use an exporter like mysqld_exporter on each MySQL pod.

Prometheus scrapes metrics, Grafana visualizes them.

Key things to monitor:

Seconds_Behind_Master – shows replication lag

Number of connections, slow queries, cache hit rate

Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)

Benefit:
Helps in capacity planning, early failure detection, and better insights into DB performance.

✅ 2. Failover Automation (MySQL Operator or Helm chart)
Why:
Right now, if your master fails, you’ll have to manually promote a slave to master. Automation makes this seamless.

Options:

Bitnami MySQL Helm chart (with HA):
Comes with master-slave setup and uses health checks for automatic failover.

MySQL Operator (like PressLabs MySQL Operator):
A Kubernetes-native way to deploy and manage MySQL clusters. Handles:

Master/slave setup

Automatic failover

Backups

Scaling

Benefit:
Zero downtime DB operations and self-healing clusters.

✅ 3. Connection Pooling & Read/Write Splitting (ProxySQL / HAProxy)
Why:
Currently, you’ve manually configured your app to hit the master for writes and replica for reads. But:

What if a replica goes down?

What if read queries suddenly spike?

Solution:
Use a connection pooler / proxy that:

Automatically routes write queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to the master

Routes read queries (SELECT) to one of the available slaves

Maintains a pool of persistent DB connections

Popular Tools:

ProxySQL

HAProxy

Benefit:

Smart query routing

Load balancing for read queries

Better performance & resilience

✅ 4. TLS & Secrets Management
Why:
Hardcoded DB passwords (rootpass, repl_pass) and unencrypted connections are not secure, especially in production.

Best Practices:

Store passwords/secrets using:

Kubernetes Secrets

External secret managers like Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Sealed Secrets

Enable TLS for MySQL connections:

MySQL supports SSL certificates

Clients can verify server identity and encrypt traffic

Use RBAC to restrict access

Least privilege user access (e.g., app user should not be root)

Benefit:
Secure data-in-transit and credentials, minimize breach risk.
